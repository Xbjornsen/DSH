## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to Use the 3D Space Builder

1. **Access the Builder**: Navigate to `/space-builder` or click "3D Builder" in the navigation
2. **Add Demountables**: Click on any demountable type in the left sidebar to add it to your space
3. **Add Furniture**: Browse furniture by category (Furniture, Kitchen, Bathroom, Laundry, Gym) and click to add items
4. **Move Objects**: Click and drag any furniture or fixture to reposition it in the 3D space
5. **Select Items**: Click on any object to see its details and delete it if needed
6. **Change Views**: Switch between Perspective and Top-Down view modes for easier positioning
7. **Save Your Work**: Click "Save Project" to download your design as a JSON file
8. **Load Projects**: Click "Load Project" to import a previously saved design
9. **Clear All**: Remove all demountables and objects to start fresh

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
